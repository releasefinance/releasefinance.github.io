### Editing Copy through Github

Each Landing Page has it's own HTML that contains all the copy in that in YAML format. 

1. Look for the html you want to edit in the [root project folder](https://github.com/releasefinance/releasefinance.github.io) e.g. page1.html.
2. Click Edit https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/103z1R071e0P3X0f1Y0r/Image%202015-06-01%20at%205.27.05%20pm.png
3. Edit YAML at top of page
4. Write commit and 'Commit Changes'
