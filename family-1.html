testimonial:
  quote : With our family growing quickly we needed a bigger car. Release allowed us to upgrade the quality as well as the size. We lend it occasionally in the week and sometimes at weekend. It helps us get the cost down, supports friends and means we don't need to compromise. It's the best, most flexible solution we could have found for our family's needs.
